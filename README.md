# pyinaturalist-export

**WIP / Not yet functional!**

[Pyinaturalist](https://github.com/niconoe/pyinaturalist) extensions to convert iNaturalist observation data to and from multiple formats.

Planned/potential features:
* Convert observation data from pyinaturalist to CSV, Excel, Parquet, and other tabular formats
* Convert to an HTML report
* Convert to Simple Darwin Core format
* (Possibly) Import observation data from the [iNaturalist export tool](https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/export) and convert it to be compatible with observation data from the iNaturalist API
* (Possibly) Import and convert observation data from [pyinaturalist-open-data](https://github.com/JWCook/pyinaturalist-open-data)
